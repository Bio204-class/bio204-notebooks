    "# Why mathematical notation?\n",
    "\n",
    "When studying quantitative concepts like statistics, mathematics, or computer science, it's typical to use short hand notation to represent various operations.  This is done because some concepts are used so frequently that it would be tedious to write out a full explanation each time they're used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of this mathematical notation can be a little intimidating at first. Don't let it scare you off. With a little practice it's easy to break the notation down into easy to understand bits."

    "Summing (adding things up) is something you do frequently in all sorts of quantitative fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently we're going to be working with sequences of numbers (mathematicians would usually call these vectors). In Python we might represent such a sequence as a `list` (or an `array` which we'll meet in a later class). In mathematics we usually give the sequence a name like $\\mathbf{x}$; when programming we might use a variable assignment like `x = [3,1,4,...]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics we represent the operation of summing the elements of a sequence with a capital Greek letter sigma ($\\Sigma$). Here's an example:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\mathbf{x}_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there are two numbers -- one above and one below the sigma.  These are the upper and lower indices of the elements we want from $\\mathbf{x}$. Note that mathematicians index sequences from one, unlike computer scientists who usually index from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, the above notation is equivalent to the written statement: \"From the sequence we call $\\mathbf{x}$, take the first 10 elements, and add them up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An equivalent statement in Python  would be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sum(x[0:10])  # sum the first ten elements of x \n",
    "```\n",
    "Remember that when slicing Python sequences, the second part of the slice is non-inclusive (i.e. we take all the elements up to but not including the element indexed by 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Often it's convenient to further abstract our notation.  Let's assume our sequence $\\mathbf{x}$ has a length we'll call $n$.  We don't necessarily know the length of $\\mathbf{x}$ ahead of time, so using the label $n$ to refer to its length let's us abstract away this detail. If we want to represent the operation of summing up *all* the elements of $\\mathbf{x}$ we could write:\n",

    "\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{x}_i\n",

    "sum(x)  # sum all the elements of x\n",
    "```\n",

    "Notice that when using sum notation, the lower index doesn't have to start at 1. For example, to represent the operation of summing up the last 10 elements of $\\mathbf{x}$ we could write:\n",

This problem is easy to solve with a for loop (Note: there are more efficient ways to do such operations, but we're aiming for conceptual simplicity).  Let's illustrate this with an example:"
